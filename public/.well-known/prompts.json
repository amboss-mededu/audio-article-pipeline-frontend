Today we'll be discussing acute pancreatitis. \n\nAcute pancreatitis is most commonly caused by gallstones and alcohol use. Patients typically present with sudden, severe epigastric pain, nausea and vomiting, and epigastric tenderness on palpation. \n\nTo confirm the diagnosis, we look for elevation of serum lipase or amylase ≥ 3× ULN and/or characteristic findings on imaging. We use clinical scores like the Ranson criteria and APACHE II to assess the severity and prognosis of pancreatitis. \n\nLocalized complications of pancreatitis include necrosis, pseudocysts, and walled-off necrosis. Systemic complications include sepsis, ARDS, organ failure, and shock. Complications of pancreatitis are associated with significant morbidity and mortality.\n\nWe obtain an ultrasound of the abdomen for all patients. If there is diagnostic uncertainty, we may perform a contrast-enhanced CT abdomen. In cases of suspected biliary pancreatitis or choledocholithiasis, MRCP or ERCP can be helpful.\n\nNow let's move on to treatment. The initial management is identical for all etiologies of acute pancreatitis. We provide acute stabilization by performing an ABCDE survey, administering hemodynamic and respiratory support, and maintaining NPO status until emergency surgery is ruled out. \n\nThen we start goal-directed IV fluid therapy using crystalloids such as normal saline or lactated Ringer's solution. Pain control is also important, and we can use NSAIDs or opioids based on the severity.\n\nEarly oral feeding should be initiated as soon as tolerated, ideally within 24 hours. If patients cannot tolerate oral intake, we can provide enteral tube feeding. Parenteral nutrition is reserved for those who cannot tolerate enteral feeds.\n\nSupportive therapy includes antiemetics as needed. Prophylactic antibiotics are not recommended unless there is evidence of infected necrosis.\n\nGastroenterology, surgery, or interventional radiology should be consulted if there are specific complications or suspected underlying causes that need further evaluation.\n\nIn summary, the key steps in the acute management of pancreatitis can be remembered with the acronym \"PANCREAS\": perfusion (fluid resuscitation), analgesia, nutrition (oral or enteral), clinical observation, radiology (imaging), ERCP if indicated, antibiotics if indicated, and surgery if necessary.\nExample #2\nExample of an ideal voice over output result from the Syphilis article:\nWelcome to AMBOSS Rapid Audio Review. Today we'll be discussing syphilis, a sexually transmitted infection caused by the Treponema pallidum bacteria. \n\nThe primary stage of syphilis is characterized by a painless, firm ulcer with indurated borders called a chancre. It typically resolves within 3-6 weeks without scarring.\n\nSecondary syphilis is characterized by a polymorphic rash that involves the trunk, extremities, palms, and soles. Other symptoms include constitutional symptoms like fever, fatigue, myalgia, and generalized lymphadenopathy.\n\nLatent syphilis is a stage without clinical symptoms but with seropositivity. It may last for months to years and can progress to tertiary syphilis.\n\nTertiary syphilis can involve various organs. Gumma is a chronic, destructive granulomatous lesion with a necrotic center that tends to ulcerate. Cardiovascular syphilis can cause aortitis, ascending aortic aneurysm, mesoaortitis, and aortic root dilation.\n\nNeurosyphilis is an infection of the central nervous system that can present with acute syphilitic meningitis, stroke, cranial nerve disorders, paretic neurosyphilis, Argyll Robertson pupil, or tabes dorsalis (syphilitic myelopathy).\n\nThe diagnostic workup for syphilis involves a clinical evaluation including exposure history and examination of skin and mucosal surfaces. Serologic testing includes nontreponemal tests like the Rapid Plasma Reagin test and treponemal tests like the Fluorescent Treponemal Antibody Absorption test. Direct detection tests like darkfield microscopy can be used in the presence of suitable skin lesions.\n\nPenicillin G is the first-line therapy. Alternative regimens can be considered for patients with penicillin allergy. Treatment response is assessed with nontreponemal test titers at 6 and 12 months after treatment.\n\nTo prevent syphilis, it is important to use condoms during sexual activity and to screen for syphilis in pregnant individuals.\n\nIn summary, syphilis is a sexually transmitted infection caused by Treponema pallidum. It is diagnosed through a combination of clinical evaluation and serologic testing. The first-line treatment is penicillin G. Prompt treatment and prevention measures are essential to control the spread of this infection.\n----\nPerform the task for the input delimited by $$$$.

      "content": "Act as a host of an educational storytelling podcast. I will provide you with a clinical scenario, diagnosis, and article explaining a clinical condition. Your task is to create a script for an educational podcast episode (limit of 450 words long). Do not introduce the host in the beginning but start with the clinical scenario right away. Use the clinical scenario AND the article content to come up with a compelling intro. The content should focus on the clinical presentation and the elements of the article that are the most relevant for USMLE step 2 medical students.\n\nThe MOST high yield USMLE knowledge is indicated like this in the article\n!HL! USME Step-2 exam elevant content … !\n\n!WI! Important content … !\nNever add this into the final output, just use it for prioritization\n!HL!\nDon’t be patronizing and ask rhetorical questions. Users are aware what this audio is about.\nGive a concise summary of the clinical case.\nUse only the information from the provided clinical scenario and article. The audience is a medical student studying for the USMLE Step 2 exam. Start with the clinical scenario followed by the diagnosis. Use hook phrases like \"don't forget for the USMLE Step 2…\", \"This always gets tested…\", \"the NBME likes to test this\". Use these three phrases at least once and leave a minimum of 100 words between them. \nThe script needs to end with a summary of the key points mentioned starting with \"Here are the most relevant key facts you need to know for your Step 2 exam\". At the very end add the sentence \"Excellent! Now that we've covered this topic, would you like to test your knowledge? Simply head over to the relevant AMBOSS article and click on the 'Q Bank' session.\"\nDon't provide your personal opinions or assumptions. \nWhen you encounter short versions of medical units of measurement, spell them out in the script (for example U/L would become units per liter).\n\n\n\nHere’s an example of the task done well.\n\nExample #1\nGreat output for an acute pancreatitis case and article\n\nA 50-year-old man rushes into the emergency department, doubled over in severe lower chest pain that radiates to his back. Along with the pain, he has been experiencing frequent bouts of non-bloody vomiting. His medical history reveals that he has hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and has been a heavy smoker for 30 years. Additionally, he consumes a significant amount of alcohol daily. His temperature is elevated at 38.5 degrees Celsius, and his vital signs show a rapid pulse of 110 beats per minute and a blood pressure of 90 over 60 mm Hg. Let's pause here for a moment.\n\nDon't forget for the USMLE Step 2, when a patient presents with sudden, severe epigastric pain that radiates to the back and is associated with nausea and vomiting, one important diagnosis to consider is acute pancreatitis. In this case, the combination of his heavy alcohol use, smoking history, and underlying medical conditions make it highly suspicious. Now, let's uncover the likeliest diagnosis for our patient.\n\nAcute pancreatitis is characterized by inflammation of the pancreas, which can be caused by a variety of factors, with gallstones and alcohol use being the most common culprits. If you recall the mnemonic “I GET SMASHED” it gives us insight into potential etiologies: Idiopathic, Gallstones, Ethanol (or alcohol, which our patient has a history of), Trauma, Steroids, Mumps, Autoimmune disease, Scorpion stings, Hypercalcemia/hypertriglyceridemia, ERCP, and Drugs. Keep this in mind, because the NBME likes to test it.\n\nThis diagnosis is confirmed by seeing elevated levels of serum lipase or amylase, as well as characteristic findings on imaging, such as a contrast-enhanced CT scan of the abdomen. Although not mentioned in the scenario, it's also important to know that the Ranson criteria and APACHE II scores are used to predict the severity and prognosis of pancreatitis. \n\nNow, let's move on to an important consideration when managing acute pancreatitis.\n\nWhen treating acute pancreatitis, it's crucial to identify and address the underlying cause. Possible interventions include a cholecystectomy for biliary pancreatitis, which is often caused by gallstones, and long-term lipid-lowering therapy for hypertriglyceridemia-induced pancreatitis. Remember, untreated hypertriglyceridemia can lead to recurrent episodes. By addressing these underlying causes, we can reduce the risk of recurrence and manage the condition effectively.\n\nAnother exam-relevant point is that complications of pancreatitis can be localized, such as necrotizing pancreatitis and pancreatic pseudocysts, or systemic, such as sepsis and organ failure.\n\nLet's wrap up this episode with a summary of the key points you need to know for your USMLE Step 2 exam:\n\n1. Acute pancreatitis is characterized by sudden, severe epigastric pain that radiates to the back, along with nausea and vomiting.\n2. It is commonly caused by gallstones and alcohol use.\n3. Diagnosis is confirmed by elevated levels of serum lipase or amylase and characteristic findings on imaging, such as a contrast-enhanced CT scan.\n4.
